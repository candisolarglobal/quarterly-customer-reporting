Python Codes and walk - through of sending the quarterly customer reports

 ---
**Background**

Reports are first generated on Google LookerStudio. Via a Python function, they are auto-downloaded into the folder Client Communication/Customer Reports.
Every quarter, they are to be sent to the customer via mail. This repo aims to provide a means to automate that by leveraging AWS functionality.
